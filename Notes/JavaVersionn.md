## Java Versions 

#### Java 8 vs java 11 
Java 8 and Java 11 are two major releases of the Java Development Kit (JDK) that introduced significant features and improvements. Here are some significant differences between Java 8 and Java 11:

1. Language Features:
    - Java 8 introduced several language enhancements, including lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and the Stream API, which revolutionized the way Java handles functional programming and processing collections.
    - Java 11 introduced local variable type inference, allowing the **`var`** keyword to be used to declare local variables with inferred types, reducing verbosity and improving readability.

2. Module System (Project Jigsaw):
    - Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), also known as Project Jigsaw. It provided a modular structure for organizing and encapsulating code, allowing developers to create more modular and maintainable applications.
    - Java 11 continued to enhance and stabilize the module system, providing better support for developing and deploying modular applications.

3. Garbage Collection:
    - Java 8 introduced the G1 Garbage Collector as an experimental feature, which is a low-pause garbage collector suitable for large heaps and high-throughput applications.
    - Java 11 made the **G1 Garbage Collector** the default garbage collector, improving overall garbage collection performance and reducing pause times.

4. Performance Improvements:
    - Java 8 and Java 11 both introduced various performance improvements, including enhanced JIT compiler optimizations, better handling of large heaps, and improved startup time for applications.

5. APIs and Libraries:
    - Java 8 introduced the Date and Time API (`java.time`) as a replacement for the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes, providing a more comprehensive and flexible API for working with dates and times.
    - Java 11 introduced several new APIs and updates, including the HTTP Client API (`java.net.http`), a new File System API (`java.nio.file`), and updates to the Java EE APIs.

6. Security Enhancements:
    - Both Java 8 and Java 11 included various security enhancements, such as stronger default cryptographic algorithms and protocols, improvements in SSL/TLS handling, and updated security libraries.

7. Long-Term Support:
    - Java 8 is a long-term support (LTS) release, which means it will receive public updates and support for an extended period, making it a preferred choice for enterprise applications.
    - Java 11 is also an LTS release, providing long-term support with regular updates and bug fixes.

These are just a few significant differences between Java 8 and Java 11. There are many other features, improvements, and bug fixes introduced in each release. It's important to consider the specific requirements and compatibility of your application when choosing a Java version.
