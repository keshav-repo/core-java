### POJO class 
POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object. It is a Java class that encapsulates data and provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the data. POJO classes are simple and do not have any special framework or library dependencies. They typically represent entities or data structures in an application.

Here are some characteristics of a POJO class:
- It has private fields to encapsulate data.
- It provides public getter and setter methods to access and modify the data.
- It may have additional methods for performing business logic or utility functions.
- It does not inherit from or implement any specific framework or library classes or interfaces.
- It does not have any annotations or dependencies on external frameworks for its basic functionality.

POJO classes are often used in various Java frameworks and applications as a simple and lightweight way to represent data structures, transfer objects, or entities without any specific framework or library constraints. They promote simplicity, reusability, and ease of testing.
