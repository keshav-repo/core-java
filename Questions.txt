Certainly! Here are a few more tricky object-oriented programming questions in Java:

1. What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading?
2. Explain the concept of encapsulation and how it is achieved in Java.
3. What is the purpose of the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in Java? How are they related?
4. What is a static nested class in Java? How is it different from an inner class?
5. How does the `final` keyword work in Java? Explain its usage with variables, methods, and classes.
6. What is the difference between composition and inheritance? When would you prefer one over the other?
7. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java. Provide an example demonstrating runtime polymorphism.
8. What is the `super` keyword in Java? How is it used in constructors and method overriding?
9. What is the Java interface? How is it different from an abstract class?
10. What are the access modifiers in Java (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`)? Explain their differences and use cases.

These questions cover various aspects of object-oriented programming in Java and can help assess your understanding of key concepts. Make sure to have a solid grasp of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and other fundamental

Detailed Summary for [Java collections framework interview questions | [MOST ASKED COLLECTIONS INTERVIEW QUESTION]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=0) Explanation of Collection Hierarchy in Java
- Collection hierarchy starts with Collection interface which is a root of the collection framework in Java.
- List, Set, Queue and Map are the three basic interfaces which implement or extend Collection interface.

[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=228) Explanation of different collection classes in Java
- ArrayList and LinkedList are two different classes that implement the List interface. ArrayList resizes by 50% while LinkedList maintains insertion order and is non-synchronized.
- Vector is a legacy class that is thread-safe and increases its size by doubling its array size.
- Stack is a class that implements the last in, first out (LIFO) data structure.
- The Set interface is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet. HashSet implicitly implements a hash table and contains only unique elements. LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order while TreeSet is sorted.

[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=438) Different interfaces and classes in Java Collections
- HashSet maintains doubly linked list for insertion order
- SortedSet stores elements in ascending order using Comparable interface
- TreeSet uses Red-Black tree for sorting and retrieval
- PriorityQueue serves elements based on priority
- ArrayDeque is a doubly ended queue for adding and removing elements from either end

[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=642) Summary of Collection Interfaces
- Queue interface has a resizable array implementation with no capacity restriction.
- Map interface is unique and does not extend the Collection interface, and has key-value pair structure.

[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=836) Map is an integral part of Java Collection Framework
- Map supports key-value pairs and is unique in the Collection Framework
- Fail-fast and fail-safe iterators differ in how they handle concurrent modification
- Blocking Queue is a Java interface for first-in, first-out queues

[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=1022) Concurrent package provides thread-safe blocking queues and collections
- Blocking queues prevent concurrency issues with multiple threads inserting and taking data
- Synchronous and concurrent collections both provide thread safety, but concurrent collections achieve it more efficiently through lock stripping

[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=1230) Hash map works on hashing principle in Java
- Hash function links key-value pair and generates index
- Map.Entry object stores key-value pair in hash table

[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfoNYoVUBJI&t=1426) Collision handling in hash table using linked lists
- Linked list is created when multiple keys generate the same index
- Get method checks every key of every node using equals method to search the correct value
